        <br>
        <p id="Potter">Harry James Potter was born on 31 July 1980, to James and Lily Potter (n√©e Evans), two members of the original Order of the Phoenix at the height of the First Wizarding War, only hours after his classmate-to-be Neville Longbottom. ... For Harry's first birthday, Sirius bought him a toy broomstick.

            To keep them safe from Lord Voldemort, who had marked them for death after hearing of a prophecy regarding his downfall at the hands of a male child born at the end of July in 1980, Albus Dumbledore suggested they use the Fidelius Charm. Dumbledore even offered to be the Potter's Secret Keeper, but the Potters had planned to make Harry's godfather Sirius Black their Secret Keeper instead. On Sirius' advice, they changed this designation to Peter Pettigrew, who they thought would be less suspicious. In a terrible turn of fate, Pettigrew was a spy and Death Eater for Voldemort and barely a week later betrayed the Potter's and gave their whereabouts.
